### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I felt like it was most beneficial to just begin on the project after the in class lessons. The topics discussed gave me enough of an introduction to React to start the project. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have spent more time on CSS and the color scheme of the website. I would also like to continue to develop my understanding of React.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My demo went well, my presentation was not loading, but I believe I was able to adjust well. I liked seeing how my peers implemented the functionailities and it gave me inspiration to continue to improve my website.
